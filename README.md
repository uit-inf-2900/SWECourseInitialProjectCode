In a Django project, the requirements.txt file is commonly used to list all the Python packages and their specific versions that are required for the project to run.
This file is often used in combination with virtual environments to ensure that everyone working on the project is using the same versions of the dependencies.

You should tailor the contents of your requirements.txt file based on the specific packages and versions your Django project depends on.

To generate a requirements.txt file for your project, you can use the following command in your virtual environment:
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

This command will create or overwrite the requirements.txt file with a list of installed packages and their versions.

When collaborating on a project, it's a good practice to include the requirements.txt file in your version control system (e.g., Git) so that others can easily install the required dependencies using:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

This ensures consistency across different development environments.

The source code of the project include the code that we had during the following lectures:
- Development of Web Applications
- Test-Driven Development.
- GitHub Guidelines

For The Secret Key:
In a Django project, the SECRET_KEY is a crucial setting used for cryptographic functions, such as creating secure session cookies and hashing passwords. It is important to keep the SECRET_KEY confidential and not share it publicly or expose it in your code repository.
To generates a random SECRET_KEY in your project settings.py file, please, follow the instructions "Steps To Get Your Secret Key" on CANVAS. Remember that the SECRET_KEY is a critical part of your application's security, and its confidentiality is vital for the overall security of your Django project.
